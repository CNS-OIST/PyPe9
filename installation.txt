Install Instructions 
============

These instructions are for Linux and OSX systems only.

Install the prerequisites quantities, nineml, jinja2 and their dependencies

Instructions for installing http://software.incf.org/software/nineml/documentation/python-api/installation/at_download/file


Install git, and pip if you have not already. 
============
On Linux:
$sudo apt-get install git
On OSX:
$sudo port install git 

Run analogous commands for installing pip.




Install quantities:
============

$sudo pip install quantities

Install jinja2:
============

$sudo pip install jinja2

Install lxml:
============

$sudo pip install lxml

Install nineml
============

It is possible to install a stable version of nineml as a pip package. There is also a nineml repository at https://github.com/tclose/nineml
However at the time of writing the INCF nineml package was seen to be working.

$sudo git clone https://github.com/INCF/nineml
$cd /usr/local/nineml/lib9ml/python	
$sudo python setup.py install


Install NineLine
============
$cd /usr/local/

There are two development branches: template_build (https://github.com/CNS-OIST/NineLine/tree/template_build) and master. At the time of writing only the master branch was seen to be working.

$sudo git clone https://github.com/CNS-OIST/NineLine

This is currently a private repository so you will be asked to enter your github credentials.

A setup.py file is being developed for nineline, however before that time it is necessary to export the python path for NineLine as was done for btmorph above. If the setup file exists ignore case A. and follow case B. instead.
	
A.
	$export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/NineLine/

B. 
	#$cd /usr/local/NineLine/nineline
	$python setup.py install
	
	$cd ~
	
test.
$python
>>import btmorph
>>import nineml
>>import nineline
>>import nineline.cells
>>import nineline.hpc
>>import nineline.importer
>>import nineline.arguments

Uninstall
============

#To uninstall if case A. sudo rm -rf /usr/local/NineLine, and modify PYTHONPATH such that it no longer refers to /usr/local/NineLine.
#If case B. sudo pip uninstall 9Line, and sudo rm -rf /usr/local/NineLine 


TODO
============

#Currently nineline morphology will not import. However previously morphology did import.

#>>import nineline.morphology as morph
#----> 1 import nineline.morphology

#/usr/local/NineLine/nineline/morphology/__init__.py in <module>()
#     23 from .utils import axially_symmetric_tensor
#     24 from .forest import Forest
#---> 25 from .tree import Tree
#     26 
#     27 try:

#ImportError: cannot import name Tree
