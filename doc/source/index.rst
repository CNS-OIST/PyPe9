Pype9
=====


"PYthon PipelinEs for 9ml (Pype9)" is a collection of Python pipelines to
simulate neuron, and neuron network, models described in NineML_ using either
Neuron_ or NEST_ as simulator backends.

Pype9 has a :ref:`Command Line Interface` (CLI), which allows experiments to be
simulated directly from NineML_ descriptions (i.e. without scripting).
Alternatively, simulations can be embedded within Python scripts by accessing
Pyp9's accessible :ref:`API`.
